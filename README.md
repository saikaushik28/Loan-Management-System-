# Smart Loan Manager (Loan Management System) using MySQL
________________________________________
# Project Objective
The objective of the Smart Loan Manager is to create a comprehensive, dynamic loan management system that streamlines data analysis, interest calculations, customer categorization, and decision-making processes. The system integrates information from multiple datasets, applies automated triggers, and filters key insights to provide actionable outputs for efficient loan and customer management.
# Key goals include:
•	Categorizing customers based on income and property area.
•	Automating interest calculations and CIBIL score-based decision-making.
•	Consolidating data from multiple sources into a unified structure.
•	Providing filtered insights through procedures for better loan tracking and management.

# 1.Modules
1. Sheet 1: Customer Income Status
•	Import Table:
Import data related to customer income status.
•	Customer Categorization:
o	Criteria: 
	Applicant Income > 15,000 → Grade A
	Applicant Income > 9,000 → Grade B
	Applicant Income > 5,000 → Middle-Class Customer
	Otherwise → Low-Class Customer
o	Create a new table to store this categorization.
•	Monthly Interest Percentage Calculation:
o	Criteria for Interest Rate: 
	Applicant Income < 5,000 (Rural) → 3%
	Applicant Income < 5,000 (Semi-Rural) → 3.5%
	Applicant Income < 5,000 (Urban) → 5%
	Applicant Income < 5,000 (Semi-Urban) → 2.5%
	Otherwise → 7%

# 2. Interest Calculations
•	Create New Fields:
o	Calculate Monthly and Annual Interest Amounts based on Loan Amount.
o	Create a table named  “customer_interest_analysis”  to store these fields.
•	Connect Data:
o	Link this table with Sheet 2 (Loan Status) for integrated output.
________________________________________
# 3. Sheet 2: Loan Status
•	Row-Level Trigger for Loan Amount:
o	Criteria: 
	Loan Amount = NULL → Loan Still Processing.
•	Statement-Level Trigger for CIBIL Score:
o	Criteria: 
	CIBIL Score > 900 → High CIBIL Score.
	CIBIL Score > 750 → No Penalty.
	CIBIL Score > 0 → Penalty Customers.
	CIBIL Score ≤ 0 → Reject Customers (Loan Cannot Be Applied).
•	Post-Processing:
o	Delete customers with Rejected and Loan Still Processing statuses.
o	Update loan amounts as integers.
•	Consolidate Data:
o	Store all fields in a table named loan_cibil_score_status_details.

# 4. Sheet 3: Customer Information
•	Import Table:
Import data from the customer info sheet.
•	Update Data:
Update gender and age based on Customer ID.
________________________________________
# 5. Sheets 4 & 5: Country, State, and Regional Information
•	Import Tables:
Import country, state, and regional datasets.
•	Data Consolidation:
o	Join all five tables without repeating fields.

# Expected Outputs
Output 1:
A unified dataset consolidating information from all five tables.
Output 2:
Mismatched data details identified using joins.
Output 3:
Filter and display customers with high CIBIL scores.
Output 4:
Filter and display customers based on types (Home, Office, Corporate).
